### About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="profile.jpg">

Hi! I am a second year PhD student at University of Maryland, College Park. I graduated with my B.Tech in Computer Science from IIT Delhi in 2014. 

### Research Interests

My primary research interests are defense against adversarial examples and interpretation of deep networks.
